## Refactor


When I do refactoring, I mostly focus on code responsibility and readability. I try to have all functions looking like this: 

```ts
function doSomething() 
{
  if(isInvalid) {
    return;
  }

  doStep1();

  if(hasError) 
  {
    throw new Error()    
  }
  
  doStep2();

  doStep3();
}
```

Basically, I often break large functions down to smaller chunks. That way, I can skim through methods and understand what they do just by looking at functions that it called. 

Fortunately, I mostly did logic extraction and renaming, so the program didn't break. I was able to fix one small bug though, by re-reading the documentation when I refactored the `ArgsParser`.

### refactor: remove duplicate parsing in ArgsParser

There was an implementation that had bugged me for a while. I was kind of storing the parsed CLI arguments in 2 places: `ArgsParser` and `Options`. Therefore, everytime I added a new flag, I had to add the flag in both classes. 

Since I used a [third-party library](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline), they suggested calling another method that received the `Options` (e.g. `Run(Options opts)`) in `Main`. However, I don't like exposing the parsing implementation of `ArgsParser` to the outside. It's like: "I don't care what the `ArgsParser` does, just give me back the parsed arguments". That was why I had a duplicate class to do the parsing internally.

Still, it was inconvenient and the code was soaked. I played around a bit with the library parsing method, and I found out that I could just attach the parsed result to an instance of class `Options` itself. Therefore, I made a static method that acted like a constructor. 

Fortunately, the two duplicate classes have the same properties, so I just need to rename `Options` to `ArgsParser` and replace `ArgsParser` constructor with the static method.

### refactor: extract to IndexFile from Generator

I noticed that my `Generator` class was quite large. I started looking for methods that didn't depend much on the state of class `Generator`, and I found the two methods for generating the index file. They only needed to know where the source of files was.

So, I extracted the logic into a new class `IndexFile`, whose constructor received a path to files needed indexing. After that, just pass the path to dist directory to `IndexFile` from `Generator`.

### refactor: rename ArgsParser to CliArgs

Naming things is hard, especially when the responsibilities of them change over commits. Initially, I named it `ArgsParser` because it was meant to be a collection of static methods that dealt with parsing CLI arguments (that was before I reached out to a third-party library). Now, it's just an storage for parsed CLI arguments; hence, the renaming.


## Rebase

`git rebase` and `git --amend` are really convenient for patching up commits. I still remember the horror when I mispelled a commit message, and I had to live with it forever. Grouping commits is a neat feature of `git rebase` too, my git history looks cleaner and the top-level messages are more relevant.
