## Goals
Check in week 2:
- Contribute to Telescope ✅
- Contribute to a React library ✅
- Contribute to TypeScript ❌

## Context
[vercel/swr](https://github.com/vercel/swr) is a React hook that is primarily used for fetching data. It has a lot of great built-in optimizations like client-side caching, revalidating on focus, etc.

[Issue vercel/swr#1683](https://github.com/vercel/swr/issues/1683) requests to add support for passing a function to `refreshInterval`, similar to [react-query `refetchInterval`](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery).

[PR vercel/swr#1690](https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1690) addresses the issue, adds tests for the new feature.

[PR vercel/swr#1691](https://github.com/vercel/swr/pull/1691) is a follow up, add another test when function returns 0 (should disable the option).

[PR vercel/swr-site#190](https://github.com/vercel/swr-site/pull/190) is a follow up, update the documentation on [swr website](https://swr.vercel.app/)

## Execution

`swr` dev setup is super straight forward. They even have a script to link the swr library to the local development instead of downloading from npm registry (this can also be done using [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-link/)). Tons of exmaples to use for testing as well.

Because it is written in TypeScript, I started with updating the type

```ts
// old
refreshInterval?: number

// new
refreshInterval?: number | ((latestData: Data | undefined) => number)
```

I could have started with the code next, but I took a bit different approach. I decided to go with [Test-driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) or TTD for short. It was really helpful, I could imagine how the expected result should be before writing code. 

I started testing by looking for any similar tests that I could copy the structure from. The first test was to check if the function behave the same way as just returning a number. I kept it simple to make debugging easier, just a function directly returned a number.

```tsx{7}
  it('should allow using function as an interval', async () => {
    let count = 0

    const key = createKey()
    function Page() {
      const { data } = useSWR(key, () => count++, {
        refreshInterval: () => 200,
        dedupingInterval: 100
      })
      return <div>count: {data}</div>
    }

    renderWithConfig(<Page />)

    // hydration
    screen.getByText('count:')

    // mount
    await screen.findByText('count: 0')

    await act(() => advanceTimers(200)) // update
    screen.getByText('count: 1')
    await act(() => advanceTimers(50)) // no update
    screen.getByText('count: 1')
    await act(() => advanceTimers(150)) // update
    screen.getByText('count: 2')
  })
```

The second test was a bit more complex. It ensured that the data passed to `refetchInterval` was the latest data, and checked if the interval was modified dynamically as well.

```tsx{7}
  it('should pass updated data to refreshInterval', async () => {
    let count = 1

    const key = createKey()
    function Page() {
      const { data } = useSWR(key, () => count++, {
        refreshInterval: updatedCount => updatedCount * 1000,
        dedupingInterval: 100
      })
      return <div>count: {data}</div>
    }

    renderWithConfig(<Page />)

    // hydration
    screen.getByText('count:')

    // mount
    await screen.findByText('count: 1')

    await act(() => advanceTimers(1000)) // updated after 1s
    screen.getByText('count: 2')
    await act(() => advanceTimers(1000)) // no update
    screen.getByText('count: 2')
    await act(() => advanceTimers(1000)) // updated after 2s
    screen.getByText('count: 3')
    await act(() => advanceTimers(2000)) // no update
    screen.getByText('count: 3')
    await act(() => advanceTimers(1000)) // updated after 3s
    screen.getByText('count: 4')
  })
```
The first version of this test made a false positive. To sum up, it was somewhat like `expect(true).toBe(true)`. That reminded me of the article [Make Your Test Fail](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/make-your-test-fail) from Kent.

After I finished writing the tests, I wrote the minimum code to make all tests passed again. It was not a complex logic, but I needed to find where the updated data defined and where I could sneak my `if/else` in without breaking the hook. My second function should have checked the logic of the updated data for me, but it gave me fake confidence in its first version.

Apart from the logic, I also tried to reuse the codebase as much as I could. While skimming through the core logic, I found some `isUndefined()` helper, so I assumed `isNumber()` should exist as well. It wasn't there, but I found `isFunction()` which was just as helpful. I also tried to mimic the code style, with comments above `if`, after `else`, and some newlines to separate logic.

During the review, [Shu Ding](https://github.com/shuding), the maintainer, pointed out a case where the function could return 0, then `refetchInterval` should be disabled just like when using with a number. That was when we decided to add another test for the 0 case in a follow-up PR.
