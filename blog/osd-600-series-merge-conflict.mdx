Fortunately, the two commits didn't have any conflicts. The first one was fast-forward, and the second one was merged recursively without me doing anything.

But, I learnt that rebasing commits are more preferable for merging branches. To sync up with the main branch, instead of `git merge main`, you do `git rebase main`. Rebasing walks you through all your changes that cause conflicts, and at the end, creates a linear commits history.

In other words, `git merge` resolves conflicts by smashing the two branch together and create a new commit to resolve those conflicts. Meanwhile, `git rebase` lifts off your branch base commit (the commit where your branch detaches from the main branch), and put that base at the HEAD of main branch. Neat.
