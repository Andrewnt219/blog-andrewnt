## Docusaurus

Docusaurus out-of-the-box blogs and docs are simply amazing. Markdown supports MDX with elegant built-in components for common cases like [Tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs), [Admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions), etc. It is also highly customizable via `docusaurus.config.js`.

Setting up a Docusaurus is as fast as running one script. Everything is ready to deploy, just need to replace some name and links.

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

Docusaurus also has an [exhaustive guide for deployment](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment). However, resolving static assets was a bit tricky. Static assets were automatically rewrited correctly in markdown files. In JSX, with the sample template homepage, the [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets) said there were three ways to import assets, but the only usable option is `useBaseUrl`. The `require` and `import` only work with images, not svgs.



## Add static images to paper

As I was struggling a bit with Docusaurus static assets, I decided to give it a try.

It was pretty straightforward from what I had imagined.

1. Parse the markdown syntax into tag `img`.

2. Copy everything in static directory to `dist` folder.

3. Point sources in markdown files to the `static` folder now inside the `dist` folder.

The first and second steps are pure coding so it wasn't complicated. The last step was quite confusing. At first, I had planned to work with relative path: going backwards from files until reach the root of `dist` folder, then go into /static. That was obviously not simple, as files could be nested multi-level down. So, I decided to give absolute path a try, and it just magically resolved on vercel (not working locally) by using `href="/static/1.jpg"`.

At the moment, the project only supports images. Moving forward, it should read assets extensions and generates approriate html tags. I'm also finding a way to test this feature locally.
