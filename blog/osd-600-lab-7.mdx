## Formatter: dotnet-format

Installation: [https://github.com/dotnet/format](https://github.com/dotnet/format)

At the moment, `dotnet-format` is going to be a part of the next .NET SDK 6. The README suggests installing `dotnet-format` as a global tool, but I wanted it to be install as a dependecies like node_modules. Therefore, I had to create a manifest for toolings first (think of it as `package.json`) before installing `dotnet-format`.

```bash
# Create a maninfest for local tools
dotnet new tool-manifest

# Install dotnet-format for this project only
dotnet tool install dotnet-format
```

`dotnet-format` is also customizable via `.editorconfig`, [with a few options available](https://github.com/dotnet/format/blob/main/docs/Supported-.editorconfig-options.md). I set it up to match my current Visual Studio Code format

```bash:.editorconfig
root = true

[*.{cs,vb}]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
end_of_line = crlf
```

Then, I add a command to rebuild local tools if someone else want to contribute

```json:package.json
"setup": "dotnet tool restore",
```

Finally, the script for formatting. Note that I also set the verbosity level (-v) to quite (q).
```json:package.json
"format": "dotnet format -v q",
```

## Linter: StyleCop Analyzers

Installation: [https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers)

StyleCop Analyzers is a really popular tool for linting C# project. It's installed as a nuget and run as the same time as the build command. Remember to install the correct version for your C# (below table is from their repo).

| C# version | StyleCop.Analyzers version | Visual Studio version |
|------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1.0 - 6.0  | v1.0.2 or higher           | VS2015+               |
| 7.0 - 7.3  | v1.1.0-beta or higher      | VS2017+               |
|    8.0     | v1.2.0-beta or higher      | VS2019                |

Because StyleCop Analyzers run on build command, the build script can be used for linting

```json:package.json
"lint": "dotnet build"
```

One final touch, StyleCop Analyzers treats lints as warnings. It is recommended to set these lints as error

```xml:project.csproj
<PropertyGroup>
  <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>
  <!-- Other properties... -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

Seem like StyleCop Analyzers doesn't like my half C#, half JavaScript conventions.

```bash
# More errors hidden

```

## Editor integration

Visual Studio Code has some really nice feature to sync your workspace everywhere. The first one is `launch.json` use to run with build command. I set up some default arguments to pass in the ssg for testing (the option `configurations.args`).

```json:launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      // Use IntelliSense to find out which attributes exist for C# debugging
      // Use hover for the description of the existing attributes
      // For further information visit https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/master/debugger-launchjson.md
      "name": ".NET Core Launch (console)",
      "type": "coreclr",
      "request": "launch",
      "preLaunchTask": "build",
      // If you have changed target frameworks, make sure to update the program path.
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/net5.0/paper-csharp.dll",
      "args": ["-i", "sample"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      // For more information about the 'console' field, see https://aka.ms/VSCode-CS-LaunchJson-Console
      "console": "internalConsole",
      "stopAtEntry": false
    },
    {
      "name": ".NET Core Attach",
      "type": "coreclr",
      "request": "attach"
    }
  ]
}
```

The second file is `settings.json`. This acts as a editor settings. Settings from _Preferences: User Settings_ (search using Ctrl + Shift + P) can be defined here. In my case, I want the formatter to automatically run on save

```json:settings.json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
}
```

Last one is `extension.json`. I didn't do it here, but I set it up on another web project. It's a way to hint other developers about extensions that make development faster. Just need to put in the IDs of those extensions.

```json:extension.json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "eamodio.gitlens",
    "dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
  ]
}
```

## Pre-commit hook: husky & lint-staged

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is a tool to set up scripts to run before changes are commited.

[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) runs your script on all staged files and re-stage those changes. For example, lint-staged re-stage your changes after your formatters make additional formatting.

```bash
# Install husky as a dependency
$ npm install husky -D

# Add an additional script "prepare" inside package.json
$ npm set-script prepare "husky install"

# Create a husky config file
$ npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm test"
```

A new directory `.husky` should appear in your project. Inside, there's a `pre-commit` file. This is basically a bash file, bash commands can be added in here. Be creative. 

```bash:pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

echo 'üê∂ Checking your commit...'

# echo an error message on fail
npm run pre-commit || echo '‚ùå Build fail. Fix errors showed above'
```

Now add a script `pre-commit` inside `package.json`. What my pre-commit do is running both the formatter and the linter. If there's an error (not warnings) in either script, husky'll exit and the code need to be fixed before commiting again.

```json:package.json
"pre-commit": "npx lint-staged --relative && npm run lint"
```

The final step is specifying a script to run on staged C# files only. A flag `--include` is passed because lint-staged pass a list of staged files to the script, and we only want to format those staged files, not all our files.

```json:package.json
"lint-staged": {
  "*.cs": "dotnet format --include"
},
```

The final `package.json` will look similar to this
```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "dotnet tool restore",
    "predev": "dotnet run -- -i sample -o dist",
    "dev": "vite dist",
    "build": "dotnet run -- -i sample -o build",
    "format": "dotnet format -v q",
    "lint": "dotnet build",
    "prepare": "husky install",
    "pre-commit": "npx lint-staged --relative && npm run lint"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.cs": "dotnet format --include"
  }
}
```

## Ending note
Finally I can check off learning all these pre-commit setup. The other is running tests.

These setup was interesting but never enough for me to dig in. But after learning about them, it's really easy to set up another one, and save so much time doing code review. Also a really great way to learn about conventions and best practices. Now, I'm off to fix those 136 linting errors. PR welcome...
