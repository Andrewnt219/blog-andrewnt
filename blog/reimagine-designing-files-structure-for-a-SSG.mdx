This is the sequence of [Designing files structure for a SSG (Rust)](/post/design-pattern-for-simple-ssg)

## What's new

### Class `ParseResult`

With the additional request for parsing Markdown, `paper` C# implementation removed the `SourceFile` class and implemented different class for each type (i.e. `MarkdownFile` and `TextFile`). `Template` is named more concisely as `HtmlFile`. Anything that genereate `ParseResult` (like `MarkdowFile.Parse()` or `TextFile.Parse()` can convert the result to .html using `HtmlFile.Parse()`. This removes the reduntdant of html parsing logic, and can easily supports and future file types.

### Separation of file types

Separating the old `SourceFile` into `MarkdownFile` and `TextFile` also help organize the methods used by different file types.

## C# vs Rust

Coding in C# certainly has less overhead to worry about (e.g. memory management), but Rust is undoubtedly more performant. As a fun experiment, I had an input directory like this

<Image
  src="/images/reimagine-designing-files-structure-for-a-SSG/experiment.jpg"
  width={1872}
  height={910}
  alt="folder structure of the experiment"
/>

The logic for both implemenetation are identical, but C# took ~5 seconds to generate the output. Meanwhile, Rust was ~1 second. Mind blowing.
