## `$ whoami`

Originally from S√†i G√≤n (a city of Vi·ªát Nam), I traveled across the globe in 2019, and have been studying [Computer Programming at Seneca College](https://sdds.senecacollege.ca/) ever since. My journey into programming shifted to web development in the second semester, after seeing the exciting nature of event-driven programming of JavaScript.

During my 2 years of practicing web development, I'm thanksful for all the free access to learning materials and tools. Paying it forward, I have always wanted to give back to the community, hence joining the open source community at Seneca College.

It wasn't until my first co-op that I realized how challenging, and rewarding at the same time, it was to work with other developers on a large-scale, real world projects. Walking into a huge projects with 0 understanding of the codebase, reading code written by others who might not even work there anymore, introducing new bugs while fixing a bug,... all of them helped me grow exponentially. I want to have more of those experiences. Therefore, I find open source development is a great place to learn.

## At the moment...

I'm working and studying in Toronto.

In my journey, I invest most of my time in Frontend technologies. My go-to frontend libraries for any projects is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) if I need a database. It's in my best interest to focus on _Developer Experiences (DX), Web Performances & Accessibilities._

## Goals & expectations

Having enrolled in the course [OSD600](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/course/osd600?q=course/osd600), I strive to have more professional presence in my field. I'm looking forward to collaborating with the like-minded developers at Seneca and the open source community as well. During the learning and working process, I hope it will eventually result in some meaningful contributions.

## First step

Enough talking, just earlier today, I have starred the repo of [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). Visual Studio Code is an IDE that I have been using on a day to day basic since the beginning of my web programming. As it is written in my favorite TypeScript, and its purpose aligns with my interest of improving DX, I find the "good-first-issue" tempting to dig in.

Cheers! üçª
