## Networking

`Rust` is not as common as other languages like `JavaScript` and `TypeScript`, so it was a bit harder to find a partner who was willing to do a code review with me. Eventually, [Antonio](https://github.com/Antonio-Bennett), who was also interested in learning Rust, contacted me and we started collaborating.

## Testing & Code Reviews

Reading someone else code when I just learned the language was both eye-opening and confusing at the same time. There were syntax or language mechanics that Antonio knew but I didn't, and vice versa. It was also nice to see a different approach to the same problem.

I was impressed that Antonio write the logic for parsing CLI's arguments from scratch. I was trying to do that at first, but there was so many edge cases so I was discouraged and just used [an existing crate](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) instead.

There were some issues with Antonio's program:

- The program allow empty value for `--input`, and created an empty `dist` [#1](https://github.com/Antonio-Bennett/rssg/issues/1)

- Code should be separated into modules for readability [#2](https://github.com/Antonio-Bennett/rssg/issues/2)

- When passing a file as `--input`, the program exited [#3](https://github.com/Antonio-Bennett/rssg/issues/3)

Antonio also found some bugs on my program:

- Handled error should exit with code 0 [#15](https://github.com/Andrewnt219/paper/issues/15)

- `dist` is generated in the current directory of running the command [#14](https://github.com/Andrewnt219/paper/issues/14)

- The program crashed when not running from the root directory [#13](https://github.com/Andrewnt219/paper/issues/13)

## Fixing

I wasn't able to fix issue [#14](https://github.com/Andrewnt219/paper/issues/14) due to the lack of means to get the path to root crate in Rust. From what I have researched, after the program is compiled, Rust does not aware of the file system anymore, so there is no tale where the root of the cwd is.

## Revising

Testing the code on my own is never enough. Getting my code tested from a different run-time environment and perspective exposes more bugs and potential improvement.
