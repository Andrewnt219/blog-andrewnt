## New features ðŸŽ‰

[trangntt-016/static-site-generator](https://github.com/trangntt-016/static-site-generator) now supports passing config file as an alternate to CLI arguments.

```bash
$ jssg -c path/to/ssg-config.json

# or

$ jssg --config path/to/ssg-config.json
```

The solution is simple. All the changes happen in the constructor `JssgApplication` (entry point of the program). If a path to a config file is passed, the appplication ignores all other values and is initialized by values from the config file instead. 

Most problem didn't come from the code itself, but from working with maven. I couldn't find the `jssg-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` mentioned inside the project README. So I came back to the issue and asked Trang for clarification. I had never worked with a Java project so I didn't know I had to run `mvn install`, which was just like `npm install` for installing dependencies. A reminder of what seems to be pretty obvious for some developers, but is obscure for others that have different programming backgrounds.

After that, I ran into another problem. I kept running `mvn compile` but the new changes weren't reflect. Eventually, I figured out I had to run `mvn install` or `mvn package` instead. Pretty weird but I didn't mind. Adding a new dependency was also quite different.

## About git remotes

Unfortunately, no issues has been filed on my two repos. Today is the due date and seems like everyone else already has a repo to work on. I'll sum up what I know about `git remote`, `git fetch`, `git pull` and `git checkout` a remote bracnh instead.

With `git remote`, you can manage your remote branches.

```bash
$ git remote add <name-of-student> <https://git-url-of-other-studnet-fork.git>
```

This will add another remote repo from `https://git-url-of-other-studnet-fork.git` to your local, as alias `name-of-student`. Now you can use `name-of-student` to refer to this remote repo in other git commands.

With `git fetch`, you can get or update all the branches from a remote repo to your local.

```bash
$ git fetch <name-of-student>
```

In order to run above command, `name-of-student` has to be added using `git remote`. This get/update all the branches from the remote repo `name-of-student`, but does not perform `git merge`.

`git pull` has similar function as `git fetch`, but it does an additional command at the end, which is `git merge`.

You can also checkout a remote branch by using

```bash
$ git checkout -b <branch-name> <name-of-student>/<branch-name>
```

This shows you the working branches of the remote repo `name-of-student` on branch `branch-name`. In other words, you now has the new changes on your local, so you can run tests on it or do whatever you want before merging the changes.
